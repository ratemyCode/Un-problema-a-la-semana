# Problems with thematic: Data Structure


I'll search the tag Data Structure on CodeForce.

This problems is about how to use Data Structure,also are the easiest
 of the CodeForces.
 
## Rules in this group:
1.- Do the contest with time Max 2.5 hours (like a official contest)
2.- Finish the problems before the next sundaythey problems


## Tips
  * Read all problems firts (search the easier problem)
  * Read many times as understand the problems 
  * Remember, coding should be less of 15 minutes,not coding without
    understand the problem, the problem is most important, code is
    only implementation.
  * if you have a bad solution do not fixed code inside, review your
    solution on paper not the code
  * Try not to stress yourself, those problems are [for the
    lulz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec#Ideology)
